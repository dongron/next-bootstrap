## What should be done next

There are w few missing parts. For example, modals, search input functionality.

There could be added more animations and slider could be smoother, maybe implemented third party slider.

Other thing is migration to `/app` type of router.

Data for job cards could be moved to the mocked requests and it's logic could be made more generic.

Some TypeScript variables could be changed to enums.
